# Steam2 Downloader

A desktop browser and downloader for the [terarelease](https://de.steam2.download/) Steam2 content
dump: 10 876 depots, 116 339 files, 13.3 TB (12.1 TiB). It shows what the archive holds, resolves
which files a given depot version actually needs, downloads them, verifies them and unpacks them.

Steam2 was Valve's content system before Steam3 and CDN manifests. Its depots are stored as delta
chains of `.dat` payloads with `.blob` metadata beside them, so no single file is a complete
version — extracting version *N* needs every version below it. This tool exists because working
that out by hand across 58 441 blobs is not practical.

Single self-contained executable for Windows or Linux. It starts a local server and opens your
browser — or, on a headless Linux server, runs with no browser at all and is reached through an
SSH tunnel instead (see [Run headless on Arch Linux](#run-headless-on-arch-linux-or-any-linux-vps)).

## Install and run

[Download `steam2browser-win-x64.zip`](https://github.com/extremebleem/steam2_downloader/releases/latest/download/steam2browser-win-x64.zip)
— that link always resolves to the newest build. Unzip and run `steam2browser.exe`. No .NET
install, no dependencies. Release notes and older builds are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/extremebleem/steam2_downloader/releases/latest).

```
steam2browser.exe                 # opens http://127.0.0.1:5099
steam2browser.exe --port=6000     # different port
steam2browser.exe --no-browser    # do not launch a browser
```

Everything it writes stays in `steam2info/` next to the executable: the name cache, downloads
(`archive/blobs`, `archive/dats`) and extracted files (`extracted/`).

The release embeds a snapshot of the whole catalog, so the first run needs no network and is ready
in well under a second. Fetching that index instead means 13 MB of `*_dates.txt` plus two ~20 MB
directory listings for the sizes — about 54 MB before anything appears. **Re-download index** in
Settings pulls a fresher one when you want it.

## Run headless on Arch Linux (or any Linux VPS)

The app is a small local web server: it listens on `127.0.0.1` and serves its UI as a website,
which is normally opened for you in a browser on the same machine. A VPS has no desktop to open a
browser on, so instead you run the server headless there and forward its port to a browser on
*your* machine over SSH — the app itself is never driven from the VPS's own console, only its port
is reached through one.

### Get the binary

[Download `steam2browser-linux-x64.tar.gz`](https://github.com/extremebleem/steam2_downloader/releases/latest/download/steam2browser-linux-x64.tar.gz)
— self-contained, no .NET install needed:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/extremebleem/steam2_downloader/releases/latest/download/steam2browser-linux-x64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/steam2browser && tar -xzf steam2browser-linux-x64.tar.gz -C ~/steam2browser
cd ~/steam2browser && chmod +x steam2browser
```

Or build it yourself (`sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk`, then see [Build from source](#build-from-source)
below with `-r linux-x64` instead of `-r win-x64`).

### Run it

```
./steam2browser --no-browser                # opens http://127.0.0.1:5099, no browser launch attempted
./steam2browser --no-browser --port=6000     # different port
```

It only ever binds to `127.0.0.1`, so it is not reachable from the internet even with no firewall
at all — the only way in is through the SSH tunnel below (or a shell on the VPS itself).

### Keep it running: systemd

A ready-to-edit unit is in [`contrib/steam2browser.service`](contrib/steam2browser.service)
(also included in the release tarball):

```
sudo useradd --system --create-home --home-dir /opt/steam2browser steam2browser
sudo mkdir -p /opt/steam2browser/steam2info
sudo cp -r ~/steam2browser/* /opt/steam2browser/
sudo chown -R steam2browser:steam2browser /opt/steam2browser
sudo cp /opt/steam2browser/steam2browser.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now steam2browser
sudo systemctl status steam2browser   # confirm it's up
journalctl -u steam2browser -f        # follow its log
```

### Reach the UI from your own machine

Forward the VPS's loopback port to your own machine over SSH, then open the UI in a browser
locally — none of your traffic leaves the SSH connection:

```
ssh -N -L 5099:127.0.0.1:5099 youruser@your-vps
```

Leave that running and open `http://127.0.0.1:5099/` in a browser on your own machine. To make
this permanent, add to `~/.ssh/config` on your machine:

```
Host steam2vps
    HostName your-vps
    User youruser
    LocalForward 5099 127.0.0.1:5099
```

then just `ssh steam2vps` whenever you want the tunnel up, and browse to the same URL.

## Features

### Browse depots

Every depot with its versions, dates, sizes and sha256 hashes. Search by depot id or product name;
quote the term for an exact match — `440` also finds 4400 and 14400, `"440"` finds only 440. Each
depot links to its [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) page. Dates render in your own locale.

### Resolve a delta chain

Where Valve reset a depot, the same version number exists twice and the chain forks. The planner
follows the parent CRC links recorded inside each blob and picks the right `.dat` by the exact size
the blob records, instead of downloading both branches. Reset depots are split into branches so a
fork does not read as one jumbled history.

### Version history and diffs

Per version: which files were added, changed and removed, with the size delta for each, expandable
like a diff view. Comparison is by path, not by file id — Steam2 assigns a new file id when a file
is rewritten, so matching on ids reports every changed file as both new and removed.

### Search inside depots

A global file search over the manifests of every blob already on disk, grouped by depot. It answers
"which depot ships `client.dll`" without downloading a single `.dat`. Results say when the index is
behind the blobs on disk and offer to rebuild it.

### Download

Parallel, resumable, verified against the sha256 that forms the fourth part of every file name.
Three HTTP mirrors (`de`, `ro`, `us`) serve byte-identical files; the app races them on startup and
picks the fastest, with a BitTorrent swarm as a fourth source.

Blobs are fetched first and dats second, on a couple of sustained connections rather than many
short ones, because the storage speeds a connection up the longer it keeps asking. Blobs for a whole
span of depot ids can be pulled at once — enough to browse history and search files across a chunk
of the archive without paying for any dat.

A browser-side mode saves a chain into a folder you pick, laid out as `blobs/` and `dats/` so the
extractor finds it, skipping files already the right size.

### Extract

Built in. The blob container, manifest, file id tables, AES-128-CFB and zlib chunk handling are all
implemented in process. Output was verified byte-for-byte against the original `extract.exe` on two
depots, one of them with a chain spanning 146 versions.

## Things worth knowing about the archive

**A missing decryption key usually does not matter.** 4 758 depots appear in the key table, but that
table only covers depots that are actually encrypted. Every file records a filemode: `1` is plain
zlib and needs no key, only `2` and `3` involve AES. In a sample of 40 depots absent from the key
table, 38 were checkable and every one was unencrypted. So a key is requested only when a file being
extracted really needs one. The original `extract.exe` refuses these depots outright, before it ever
looks at the filemodes.

**223 `(depot, version)` pairs have a blob but no dat**, and 62 depots have gaps in their chain.
Those are flagged `incomplete`, because extraction fails partway through. 303 depots were reset at
some point.

**The mirrors are not interchangeable in behaviour.** They serve identical bytes, but `de` advertises
`Accept-Ranges` and then ignores a `Range` header on `.dat` files, answering `200` with the whole
body instead of `206`. Directory listings are sent chunked with no `Content-Length` at all. Both are
handled: a partial file is never appended to a full-body response, and an interrupted download picks
between resuming on a mirror that honours ranges and restarting on a faster one, whichever finishes
sooner.

## Build from source

Needs the .NET 10 SDK (on Arch: `sudo pacman -S dotnet-sdk`).

```
cd Steam2Browser
dotnet run
```

`dotnet run` targets whatever platform you're on — Windows, Linux or macOS — with no extra flags.

Release build, self-contained (bundles its own .NET runtime, so the target machine needs nothing
installed). Pick the runtime identifier for where it will run:

```
# Windows
dotnet publish Steam2Browser/Steam2Browser.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -o out

# Linux (Arch and others)
dotnet publish Steam2Browser/Steam2Browser.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true -o out
```

## Credits

The archive, the original C++ extractor and the depot key table come from the terarelease dump.
Please mirror and seed it.

Depot names come from [dr3murr/steam2-winfsp](https://github.com/dr3murr/steam2-winfsp), whose
[`data/depot_labels.tsv`](https://github.com/dr3murr/steam2-winfsp/blob/main/data/depot_labels.tsv)
puts a real product name on 10 870 of the 10 876 depots here. That is painstaking work and it is
what makes the archive searchable at all — a manifest only ever yields folder names like `cstrike`
or `platform`. Depots it marks `Unknown / No Depot` fall through to this app's own naming passes,
which read the manifest inside each blob and ask the Steam store about each depot id.
